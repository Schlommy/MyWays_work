0,It's really challenging for a teacher to balance and survive in a very frequently changing (daily basis)  academic policies and time table for teachers . But we balance ourselves in the environment of doubt and suspense by the management towards the teachers. They are openly announcing that teachers are not very important for the management any time they can force teachers to submit  their resignation  paper or can terminate them. We manage ourselves every day from the first hour of our joining to last moment of our job tenure at that organizations with full of uncertainty and insecurities of job. I really enjoy it I am really thankful to the management of DPS Mahendragarh for giving me the opportunity to serve them.,"Huge partiality politics and unhealthy work environment.

1,Tension free job. One would have enough time for learning and exploring the subject knowledge.,"No job security in DPS, Chhindwara. Always the management points out with silly reasons which would be no way useful for the upliftment of the school or employ. No proper management skills. Employs in administration department always disturbs the Teachers mental patience. Lot of discrimination between North and South Indians. Teacher can explore his / her knowledge by reading books or by practicing him /her self but not because of students. Very indisciplined campus. The head of the school never takes care of any useful things. Principal is a puppet in one word, Principal completely acts according to his higher authorities whatever they say and doesn't even use his commonsense for any issue. 
The main point I would like to mention here is, they recruit teachers coming to Hyderabad or some other places. After going there, they will give you target to complete the syllabus by November end or December first week. Then, they will show some reason and fire the faculty who was recruited from out with higher salaries. Now, they recruit someone for completing the revision work for CBSE board exam by paying less salaries. All just the business they do.",1,0,1,1,1,0,1,5

Its gym facility in new bangalore srr3 building is great. Sometimes i feel that is why i extended my stay at Intel otherwise i was heavily irritated with the type of profile I was in.,"Its vision is very streamlined and too much focused on hardware only. Although it tries to project that it values software too but it is only in words not much when it comes to ""putting the money where the mouth is."" If you are looking for growth in Data science / machine learning domain then it is not the company for you as it only knows/cares about how to sell its hardware and everything else is secondary. 
It has no vision in machine learning and you are not going to see products like  Alexa or Google Assistant coming out of intel any soon.
So run as far as you can from Intel if you are interested in data domain. In this domain it is focused more on providing the hardware to execute the algorithm efficiently, not much effort on the actual ML/AI which is a game changer of next century. In my honest opinion it is going to miss this bus of ML just like intel missed out on mobiles.  
Its stance on machine learning is like the following :
""Imagine a company that makes fuel for rockets and then claims to be working on rocket technologies, that is how Intel is to machine learning"" 
You can look at its acquisition, when google has acquired firms like deep mind and deep brain, intel acquires nervana which makes hardware for AI. Its acting like a wannabe and its average knowledge on AI/ML is pretty low compared to google/amazon/msft or even flipkart i suppose (more that 90% sure about this). 
Its biggest problem is business model that restricts it from innovating freely in domains other than processors because it runs into competition with its own customers like google/amazon/hp etc who use its processors in their products.
So its pretty much a dead end when it comes to pure machine learning work, so if you are not excessively excited about hardware and going through undocumented code irritates you to the core you will leave intel soon.
Over all its work culture is great and has flexible timings, you can come and leave at any time as long you get the work done.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2

1. Lack of respect in a genuine sense by the TL and managers for female employees. 
2. Poor grievance redressal. I received a hate and abusive message on my Facebook account. However, no action was taken against my grievance. 
3. Male employees are given undue power by the TL and the manager to pass gender biased comments such as ""Ladkiya to timepass ke liye job karti hain..inka koi career nahi hota"". And the manager and the TL will not take a stand for the integrity of a female employee.
4. Leaves were duly granted but later I was harassed and blamed for unplanned leaves.
5. The variable bonus is dispersed in absolute prejudice. The AM and TL would unjustifiably distribute the highest bonus to the person who has the maximum number of errors and lacks initiative in the process. 
6. The TL and AM conspired against me by asking the team members to write fake mails against me to terminate my services or force me for an IJP.
6. When adequate support was not extended from the AM, TL, People Advisors and the HR managers, I had to reach out to the national HR head and Grievance Redressal team in Bangalore for the derogatory remarks and lack of transparency in variable bonus disbursement. Eventually, I realize that the bitter truth that if a person has a progressive approach and critically analyzes the situation and seeks a justifiable work environment and transparency in recognition for work, that person is bound to pay a cost.

There are various reasons to assert the claim, that my life as an Indian Army officer, was the best thing that happened in my life.
You are a class one gazetted officer at age 21 years. At the tender age you enjoy the responsibility of commanding hundred battle hardened troops placed under your command, who are ready to do and die at your order.
Human resources management and development is a constant bench mark. Training is routine. New equipment, doctrines and technology update keeps you and your men abreast. Aim of training is to eliminate enemy and protect your men.
Administration is guided by time tested systems, regulations and procedures.
Adaptability and adjustment to new terrain and environment is inbuilt and ingrained in an Army officer.
Decision making is another attribute that distinguishes a soldier from the others.
Selflessness, dedication and commitment to the impending job is total, unmindful of personal comfort. The organisation is supreme.
Strong belief in team spirit and collective achievement in organisational interest.
As an Army officer with few of the many attributes mentioned above, I have successfully contributed to the growth of the companies I served after my Retirement. I am sure a company with sound foundation will definitely benefit from my services.
Thanks to the Indian Army for having groomed and inspired me with an outstanding confidence.
WE CAN, WE WILL.","I have no words to denounce anything about the Indian Army.
There were tremendous challenges and difficulties. But then overcoming the same is something one relishes to remember.
I have completed my complete tenure with flying colours, in the Army.

Because there are so many hidden rules, accordingly the net salary is become too less after deducting that type of hidden cost.
(2) There is no any large scale project. So that there is no any job security for most of the employee. In this situation, many employee try to relocate to another company for the stability. 
(3) Regarding the leave , there is suffix and prefix system, that's why the employee who came from different state , have to face problem. As per company's rules and regulation, PL (Privealage leave) will be evaluated depending on basic salary but LOP (Loss of pay ) will be calculated depending on gross salary.
(4) Most of the person who hold senior level or management post , may say to improve or build the the new one for facilitating the present and upcoming project but they can not accept the built up or newly one system even after getting approval with validation.

Not only there is a Difference in the Name that you see above but also there is a drastic Discrepancy in terms of Remuneration, Facilities and Benefits.
Sharing my personal experience: 
I sat for Infosys Drive and I cleared 4 rounds as it is an Off Campus.
And I was being told that ""You are being hired for Infosys Limited"" 
After I submitted all my Original Documents for verification before I go for Induction and training that takes place in Mysore, at the end moment I was being told that ""We dont have any batch vacancies now for Infosys Limited so nothing to worry, you can work for Infosys BPO Limited.Later on if you want you can change your domain to Infosys Limited through IJP (Internal Job change)""
Me being a fresher without knowing much difference about it, I agreed to be associated with IBPO.","After the Induction and Training in Mysore then I was allocated for Intel Project.
Its been 11 months in Infosys and these are the following things that will demoralize you before you step into Infosys BPO:
- Extremely less Salary and top of that you will have more deductions.
 For Freshers in hand salary is 12,500/- and including all obscure deductions you will be left with not more than 11,000/-. Whereas in Infosys Limited, an employee earns 28000 to 30000 being freshers.
- Shift Allowances Facility is much more favorable to IL as compared to IBPO.
 IL earns 250 per afternoon shift everyday and 350 in night shift everyday.
whereas in IBPO, if you work for the entire month in night shift you will be only paid 1200 to 1300.
- Good Appraisal for IL and negligible appraisal for IBPO.
